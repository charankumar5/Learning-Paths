- Protecting branches and enabling merge restrictions
- Implementing approval workflows in Merge Requests
- Using GitLab for Enterprise-level role-based access control (RBAC)

### GitLab Pages
- Deploying static websites with GitLab Pages
- Setting up custom domains, SSL, and continuous deployment of static sites

## 4. Advanced GitHub Features
