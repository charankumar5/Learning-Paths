# Python & C++ Learning Plan (3-Months, 5 Hours per Day)

That's a great goal! Since you have 3 months and can dedicate 5 hours per day, you're in a good position to make significant progress in either Python or C++. However, both languages have different learning curves and use cases, so let's first explore which one might be better for you to focus on.

### **Python**:
- **Ease of Learning**: Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it easier for beginners to pick up.
- **Applications**: It's widely used in fields like web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and scripting.
- **Advanced Topics**: As you progress, you'll focus on advanced topics like metaprogramming, multi-threading, performance optimization, and interacting with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Flask.

### **C++**:
- **Complexity**: C++ has a steeper learning curve compared to Python, especially when you dive into memory management, pointers, and advanced features like templates.
- **Applications**: C++ is a go-to language for systems programming, game development, high-performance applications, and embedded systems.
- **Advanced Topics**: Advanced C++ topics will cover areas like memory management, design patterns, multi-threading, performance optimization, and template metaprogramming.

### Suggested Approach: **Python First, Then C++**

Here’s why:  
1. **Python’s Simplicity** will allow you to build a strong foundation in programming concepts. It’s easier to get started with, and you'll be able to make progress quickly. Once you’re comfortable with programming concepts in Python, transitioning to C++ becomes smoother.
2. **C++’s Complexity** can take time, especially in terms of understanding low-level concepts like memory management, which might overwhelm you if you start with it.

### **Plan (3-Months, 5 Hours per Day)**

#### **Month 1: Focus on Python**

**Week 1-2: Basics of Python**
- **Variables, Data Types, Operators**
- **Control Flow**: if-else, loops (for, while)
- **Functions & Recursion**
- **Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets**
- **Basic I/O operations**

**Week 3-4: Intermediate Python Concepts**
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **File Handling**: Read/write files, CSV handling
- **Error Handling**: try/except, custom exceptions
- **Libraries**: Introduction to libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, or `pandas` for data manipulation.

#### **Month 2: Advanced Python + Start C++**

**Week 5-6: Advanced Python Concepts**
- **Generators and Iterators**
- **Decorators and Context Managers**
- **Regular Expressions**
- **Concurrency & Multi-threading**
- **Advanced OOP Concepts**: Metaclasses, class decorators, etc.

**Week 7-8: Python Projects and Libraries**
- **Web Development**: Learn Flask or Django (create a small web app)
- **Data Science**: Use libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for a mini-project (data analysis or ML)
- **Automation**: Use `selenium` or `requests` to automate some task (e.g., web scraping)
  
**Week 7-8 (C++ Introduction)**
- **C++ Basics**: Syntax, variables, data types, operators
- **Control Flow**: if-else, loops (for, while)
- **Functions & Recursion**
- **Basic I/O Operations**

#### **Month 3: Advanced C++ Concepts**

**Week 9-10: Deep Dive into C++**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, constructors/destructors, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Pointers, References, and Memory Management**: Understanding the heap vs stack, dynamic memory allocation, and `new`/`delete`
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Vectors, maps, sets, iterators, and algorithms

**Week 11-12: Advanced C++ Topics**
- **Templates**: Function templates, class templates, template specialization
- **Design Patterns**: Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.
- **Multi-threading**: Using `thread` and mutexes in C++
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling, memory leaks, and optimization techniques

**Final Week: Capstone Projects**
- **Python Project**: A full-fledged web app (Flask/Django) or data analysis project
- **C++ Project**: A small but complex C++ project, like a simple game engine or a multi-threaded application

  - [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  - [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

- **C++**:

  - [C++ Programming](https://www.cplusplus.com/)
  - [Effective C++ by Scott Meyers](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Software-Development-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321334876)

### **Daily Schedule** (5 Hours)
1. **Theory (2 hours)**: Study documentation, tutorials, or textbooks.
2. **Hands-On Practice (2 hours)**: Work on exercises, small programs, or challenges (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces).
3. **Project Development (1 hour)**: Work on your own project (Python/C++).

This plan assumes you're comfortable with staying consistent and have a strong focus, as it’s quite ambitious. If you feel that one of the languages is too complex to handle in 3 months, you can always adjust by extending the time spent on one language.
