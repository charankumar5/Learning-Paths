- Working with Docker Networks (`docker network create`, `docker network inspect`) 
- Docker Compose Networking 
- DNS resolution and service discovery in Docker 
- Networking between containers on different hosts using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes 

## 6. Docker Volumes
- Understanding Docker volumes vs. bind mounts 
- Working with volumes (`docker volume create`, `docker volume inspect`, `docker volume rm`) 
- Sharing data between containers using volumes 
- Volume drivers and backup strategies 

## 7. Docker Registries
- Understanding Docker Hub, private registries, and custom registries 
- Pushing and pulling images to/from Docker Hub 
- Setting up and configuring a private Docker registry 
- Security considerations for Docker registries 
- Authentication and access control for Docker registries 

## 8. Docker Security
- Understanding Docker security concepts 
- User namespaces and security best practices 
- Securing Docker containers (Minimizing attack surface, privilege escalation) 
- Docker Content Trust (DCT) 
- Using Docker Bench for Security 
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and security contexts in Docker 

## 9. Docker Swarm
- Introduction to Docker Swarm (Swarm mode) 
- Deploying services in Swarm mode 
- Managing a Swarm cluster (nodes, managers, workers) 
- Service replication and scaling in Docker Swarm 
- Overlay networks in Docker Swarm 
- Rolling updates and rollback in Docker Swarm 
- Secrets and configurations in Docker Swarm 

## 10. Docker for CI/CD
- Docker in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines

- Dockerizing a development environment for CI 
- Automating container builds and deployments using Docker 

## 11. Docker Logging and Monitoring
- Logging in Docker containers 
- Using logging drivers in Docker (`json-file`, `syslog`, `journald`, etc.) 
- Monitoring container performance with Docker stats and other tools 
- Centralized logging and monitoring with tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus and Grafana 

## 12. Docker and Kubernetes (Advanced)
- Introduction to Kubernetes and its relationship with Docker 
- Docker’s role in Kubernetes (containers as workloads) 
- Deploying Docker containers to Kubernetes clusters
